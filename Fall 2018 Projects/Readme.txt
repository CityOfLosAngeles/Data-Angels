LA Out Migration Trends:

Scope: The scope of this project is to understand the reasons why Angelenos are migrating out of Los Angeles to either more affordable regions of California or other states such as Arizona, Nevada and Texas. 
Analysis should include summary level statistics on demographic information for Angelenos displaced as well as time varying trends that predict communities at risk. 
This analysis should also include economic characteristics (income, educational attainment, job status, industry) of out migrating Angelenos and predict a wage and housing cost burden ratio that becomes a determining factor in Angelenos moving out of  Los Angeles. 


Where are the People and Where are the Jobs?:

Scope: The scope of this project is to quantify average commute times in each of the Los Angeles Times Neighborhoods. 
The average commute times will be used as a proxy for livability/ quality of life. Do residents of South LA on an average experience more commute times to work than residents of West LA? 
This analysis should be able to uncover such trends. How do these trends change over time? In each of the neighborhoods what are the top 3 commute options ( car, subway, bus, bike, etc.)? In each of the neighborhoods, what are the top 3 industries? For each neighborhood, what percentage of people drove to work alone?

Assessing the Supply and Demand of Employment and Skills in Los Angeles:

Scope: The scope of this project is to identify skills mismatch in the types of jobs available (demand side) in Los Angeles and the types of courses provided by various community colleges (supply side) in LA, in those fields. 
The analysis will include both quantitative and qualitative research. The initial scope of the project will be limited to Construction and Health Care industries and future analysis could be expanded to in demand industries such as digital, big data and information technology.
