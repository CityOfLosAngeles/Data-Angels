The pipefitters plan and lay out the needed routing, placement, pitch, incline, and elevation of systems and equipment. The pipefitters figure pressures in the systems and see that the piping, valves, fittings, and equipment are proper for the work. The pipefitters complete installations, modifications, and repairs with little or no check during their progress or upon completion. The pipefitters test systems and equipment after completing work for proper circulation, flow, pressure, and leak-free joints. The supervisor checks the pipefitter's overall work to see that it meets accepted trade standards.
