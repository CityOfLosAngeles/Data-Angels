 I am a Home Health/Home Infusion RN for Community Home Health. I work autonomously with a multidisciplinary staff to provide the full spectrum of medical, psychosocial, and rehab needs. I serve as a liaison between the hospital and the community by initiating, intervening, and evaluating multidisciplinary care for patients and their families in their home. I care for patients across the age and socioeconomic spectrum. Some of the things I do in the home are: Disease management, systems assessment, and patient and family education about their medications, diet and lifestyle to maximize quality of life and recovery. I work with Clinical Pharmacists to provide high tech IV therapy and nutrition in the patients home, Wound Specialists to promote wound healing for acute and chronic wounds, Physical Therapists and Occupational Therapists to maximize strength, mobility, and ADL function, Medical Social Workers to assist with coping and coordinate community resources. I lead a patient care team of RN’s, LVN’s, and Home Care Aids to maximize efficiency and patient outcomes.
 Let me begin by saying I love my job and I would not do anything else!!!! I think what I love the most is seeing patients who are in need of my knowledge and care.   When I see a patient and they tell me it seems you really care it blesses me immensely.  I think what really touch's me is a patient who has very little and they are so appreciative they always give you water, fruit or whatever they have.  Many times I have gone back to my car and cried over their generosity, because they have so little.
 I know a lot of my patients would say I have done so much for them, but I would say they have done more for me.  They make me feel important and valuable as a nurse which is a great feeling.
Our patients are people just like us maybe with different problems and living conditions, but people just the same. They are someone's mother, daughter, sister, father, brother, or son. They are people when they are ill in need of a gentle word or touch.  If you look in their eyes some are just waiting for a smile and reassurance.  My patients bless me each and every day.
