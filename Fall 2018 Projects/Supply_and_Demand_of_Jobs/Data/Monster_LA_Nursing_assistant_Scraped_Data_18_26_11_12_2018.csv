This examination will remain open until the needs of the service are met and is subject to closure without prior notice.  
 WDAC TRAINING PROGRAM:
The Workforce Development, Aging and Community Services (WDAC) training program supports the Board of Supervisor's recently enacted Local and Target Worker Hire Policy. This policy places local residents served into an accredited Nursing Attendant training program and provides educational support throughout the training from program admittance to State certification.
 
The trainees who complete the Nursing Attendant program and obtain State certification as a Nursing Assistant with the California Department of Public Health will be used to fill Nursing Attendant I vacancies throughout the Department of Health Services as they occur.  

DEFINITION:
Provides basic nursing services to both child and adult inpatients or to children of preschool age in the custody of County day care nurseries.

CLASSIFICATION STANDARDS:
Basic nursing care of adults, children and adolescents in an inpatient setting: Nursing Attendants I in this assignment are assigned to wards housing at least some patients who are chronically ill but who are stable and require some bedside care and the observation and reporting of behavior and manifest signs of their physical condition. Patients who are acutely ill or unstable or who require extensive or specialized treatment are assigned to other nursing personnel for care. Positions in this class may also move patients from one hospital area or ward to another and assist in moving patients from beds to stretchers. Nursing Attendants I are responsible for performing specific nursing care tasks defined for them in a nursing plan. The plan for such care is specified in detail for each patient by a registered nurse or physician and methods for providing this care are prescribed. Within this context positions in the class are responsible for maintaining a planned environment that is physically and emotionally conducive to patient comfort and safety. To do this, the worker furnishes personal services such as assisting patients in grooming, hygiene and feeding; gives reassurance and other emotional support to the patients; accompanies or transports patients to clinic, therapy, recreation and other off-the-ward activities; and monitors patients' condition and taking vital signs and observing and reporting patient symptoms and behavior. Because many patients require help in meeting their needs, much of the work of many positions in this class involves long periods of standing and walking and some stooping lifting.

OPEN COMPETITIVE JOB OPPORTUNITY

DEFINITION:
Provides basic nursing services to both child and adult inpatients or to children of preschool age in the custody of County day care nurseries.

CLASSIFICATION STANDARDS:
Positions allocable to this class perform one of the following two assignments: Nursing care of stable and basically well and normal newborn infants and children of preschool age: Nursing Attendants I in this assignment are assigned to hospital nursery wards and nursery facilities and day care nurseries of County hospitals or other health facilities. Infants and children of preschool age cared for by such positions may be suffering minor injuries or distress; however, children who become very ill or unstable are cared for by others. In this assignment, Nursing Attendants I are responsible for providing a safe, caring and comfortable environment for infants and children in their care. Basic nursing care of adults, children and adolescents in an inpatient setting: Nursing Attendants I in this assignment are assigned to wards housing at least some patients who are chronically ill but who are stable and require some bedside care and the observation and reporting of behavior and manifest signs of their physical condition. Patients who are acutely ill or unstable or who require extensive or specialized treatment are assigned to other nursing personnel for care. Positions in this class may also move patients from one hospital area or ward to another and assist in moving patients from beds to stretchers.In either assignment Nursing Attendants I are responsible for performing specific nursing care tasks defined for them in a nursing plan. The plan for such care is specified in detail for each patient by a registered nurse or physician and methods for providing this care are prescribed. Within this context positions in the class are responsible for maintaining a planned environment that is physically and emotionally conducive to patient comfort and safety. To do this, the worker furnishes personal services such as assisting patients in grooming, hygiene and feeding; gives reassurance and other emotional support to the patients; accompanies or transports patients to clinic, therapy, recreation and other off-the-ward activities; and monitors patients' condition and taking vital signs and observing and reporting patient symptoms and behavior. Because many patients require help in meeting their needs, much of the work of many positions in this class involves long periods of standing and walking and some stooping lifting.
