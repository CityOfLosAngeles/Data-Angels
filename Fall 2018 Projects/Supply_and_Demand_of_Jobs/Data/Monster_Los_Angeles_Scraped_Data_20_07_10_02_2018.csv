Construction Project Engineer - MEP,Walsh Construction,"Los Angeles, CA","Overview
Walsh is currently seeking a Project Engineer for our Crenshaw/LAX Transit Corridor Project for our California Heavy Civil South team.
 Are you someone who thrives on managing production and solving problems? Are you excited about working for a family company where, when you push yourself, you will be recognized? For Walsh Project Engineers, a good day is getting everything done on their to-do lists or solving a pesky problem. A great day, is when they get to do both.
Walsh Project Engineers are easy to follow because they speak with precision, order and efficiency. They get things done because they plan their work and then work their plan. Are you a Project Engineer that puts the same amount of care into managing relationships as you do into managing production? Are you just as good at explaining contracts as you are at scoping them? If so, we might have something for you.
As a fourth generation family owned business, Walsh recruits Project Engineers that will take ownership for ensuring things are handled right. Are you someone who likes to say “yes” to taking on more? Are you someone who gets things started without being asked?
