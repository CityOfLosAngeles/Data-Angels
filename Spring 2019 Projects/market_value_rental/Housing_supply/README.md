    "\n",
    "- Investigate a general trends on housing supply over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Which neighborhoods provide highest/lowest housing supply?\n",

    "\n",
    "[\"A Certificate of Occupancy\"](https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Building-and-Safety-Certificate-of-Occupancy/3f9m-afei) is a document issued by the Department of Building and Safety certifying a building's compliance with applicable building codes and other laws, and indicating it to be in a condition suitable for occupancy. The data is cleaned for including only building related information and saved as [\"Certificates of Occupancy AD Edited -Data.csv\"](./Data/Certificates%20of%20Occupancy%20AD%20Edited%20-%20Data.csv) before conducting initial investigation. \n",
