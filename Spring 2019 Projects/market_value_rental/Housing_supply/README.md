# Problem Statement

- Investigate a general trends on housing supply over time. 

- Which neighborhoods provide highest/lowest housing supply?

- Generate choropleth maps to show the change of housing supply from 2013 to 2019

# Dataset Description

["A Certificate of Occupancy"](https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Building-and-Safety-Certificate-of-Occupancy/3f9m-afei) is a document issued by the Department of Building and Safety certifying a building's compliance with applicable building codes and other laws, and indicating it to be in a condition suitable for occupancy. The data is cleaned for including only building related information and saved as ["Certificates of Occupancy AD Edited -Data.csv"](./Data/Certificates%20of%20Occupancy%20AD%20Edited%20-%20Data.csv) before conducting initial investigation. 

# Key Takeaways:

# Future Works:

- Investigate the relationship between prices of housing and housing supply.
- Is the housing supply keep pace with demand(e.g. population growth)?
