Pros:
-Variety of data sources and variables available
-Analysis shows shifts and changes over time particularly with median rent price and race

Cons:
-5-year estimates; however 1-year estimates will have a smaller sample size and less census tracts represented; also, percent change year-over-year cannot be cleanly calculated
-Level is at the census tract-level; depending on the units of rent prices available there may need to be some manipulation or search for another source (i.e., neighborhood level)

Next steps: all are dependent on discussion of the group
-Pull 1-year data; also, search for any other possible data sources
-Calculate year-over-year changes
-End goal: provide a file that can be merged to the level (i.e., neighborhood) and year of the rent price data to test correlations, investigate relationships, and create emodel
