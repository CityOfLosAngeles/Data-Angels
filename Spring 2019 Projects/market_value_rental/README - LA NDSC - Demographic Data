README - LA NDSC - Demographic Data
May 13, 2019
Demographic Data: Alfonso Berumen

I’ve mostly analyzed the NDSC versions of the ACS as they have merged on neighborhood.  I graphed on maps, separated by census tract several different variables that I could find on an annual basis.  Those that were pulled from the ACS include: 1) Median Rent Price, 2) Median 3) Household Income, 4) Unemployment Rate, 5) Rent-Burdened, 6) Overcrowded Houses, 7) Housing Stability, and 8) Race.  I also plotted a count of subsidized housing based on the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

Summary:
Pros: 
-Variety of data sources and variables available 
-Analysis shows shifts and changes over time particularly with median rent price and race

Cons: 
-5-year estimates; however 1-year estimates will have a smaller sample size and less census tracts represented; also, percent change year-over-year cannot be cleanly calculated 
-Level is at the census tract-level; depending on the units of rent prices available there may need to be some manipulation or search for another source (i.e., neighborhood level)
-Also, 1-year are for geographies of 65,000 or larger; in addition, the level available is “Place” or incorporated places and census designated places
-See a description of when to use 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year estimates: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/estimates.html

Next steps: all are dependent on discussion of the group 
-Pull 1-year data; also, search for any other possible data sources 
-Calculate year-over-year changes 
-End goal: provide a file that can be merged to the level (i.e., neighborhood) and year of the rent price data to test correlations, investigate relationships, and create a model
