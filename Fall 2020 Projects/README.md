This project was built to help aide LA City officials gauge the movement of Covid-19 cases throughout the City of Los Angeles with respect to points of interest. It is built with limited local machine intervention: in this case Google Drive and Colab are the main platforms used to run the code. A user need only have a google account to run this model locally.
